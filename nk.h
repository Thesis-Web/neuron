/* nk.h (2026-10-30): the neuron kernel's regions. Numbers only; the encoder is the one place a symbol's spelling lives.
   A brain is a region: its encoder, its neurons (each a region of shards keyed by (before, trigger)), its runs (seq, sheet, receipts),
   its memories, its timeline, its mailboxes, its hop stack. Two rules: no choice points, no scans (see DESIGN-nk). */
